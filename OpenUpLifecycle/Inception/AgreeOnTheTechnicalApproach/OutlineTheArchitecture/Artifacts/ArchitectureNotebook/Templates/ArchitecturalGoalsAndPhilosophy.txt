[Describe the philosophy of the architecture. Identify issues that will drive the philosophy, such as: Will the system be driven by complex deployment concerns, adapting to legacy systems, or performance issues? Does it need to be robust for long-term maintenance? 
Formulate a set of goals that the architecture needs to meet in its structure and behavior. Identify critical issues that must be addressed by the architecture, such as: Are there hardware dependencies that should be isolated from the rest of the system? Does the system need to function efficiently under unusual conditions?]
