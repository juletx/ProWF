[Describe the architectural views that you will use to describe the software architecture. This illustrates the different perspectives that you will make available to review and to document architectural decisions.]
Recommended views
- Logical: Describes the structure and behavior of architecturally significant portions of the system. This might include the package structure, critical interfaces, important classes and subsystems, and the relationships between these elements. It also includes physical and logical views of persistent data, if persistence will be built into the system. This is a documented subset of the design.
- Operational: Describes the physical nodes of the system and the processes, threads, and components that run on those physical nodes. This view isnâ€™t necessary if the system runs in a single process and thread.
- Use case: A list or diagram of the use cases that contain architecturally significant requirements.
