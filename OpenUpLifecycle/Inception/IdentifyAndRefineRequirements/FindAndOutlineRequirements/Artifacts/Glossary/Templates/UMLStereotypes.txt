[This section contains or references specifications of Unified Modeling Language (UML) stereotypes and their semantic implications—a textual description of the meaning and significance of the stereotype and any limitations on its use—for stereotypes already known or discovered to be important for the system being modeled. The use of these stereotypes may be simply recommended or perhaps even made mandatory; for example, when their use is required by an imposed standard or when it is felt that their use makes models significantly easier to understand. This section may be empty if no additional stereotypes, other than those predefined by the UML and the Rational Unified Process, are considered necessary.]
