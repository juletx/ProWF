2.3	<aGroupofTerms>
[Sometimes it is useful to organize terms into groups to improve readability. For example, if the problem domain contains terms related to both accounting and building construction (as would be the case if we were developing a system to manage construction projects), presenting the terms from the two different sub-domains might prove confusing to the reader. To solve this problem, we use groupings of terms. In presenting the grouping of terms, provide a short description that helps the reader understand what <aGroupofTerms> represents. Terms presented within the group should be organized alphabetically for easy access.]
